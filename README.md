# NLPT (Non-Linear Programming Tool)

## Overview:
This program is intended to solve, plot, and model non-linear solutions. This program will eventually have a full GUI and apply parallel processing using openACC.

## Dependancies (in the future...):
* QT 5.12 
* pgcc compiler (c / c++)

## Development:
1) Solve up to 3rd order ODE's.
2) Apply parallel processing where applicable.
3) Make GUI for input / output.
4) Add plotting feature.
5) Add database modeling feature.
